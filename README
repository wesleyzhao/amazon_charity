CHANGELOG

11/30 
Added passive tagging
      - if you are on a product page, it will automatically
      detect that, check if your affiliate tag is already
      loaded, and if not then it will reload the page appending
      your affiliate tag
      - a RED notification under the title of the product will
      always show which affiliate tag is currently being used

Added customization
      - If you open up Settings > Options > Extensions and find
      the extension, you can click the "Options" button and
      set your affiliate tag yourself

12/1

      - from viewig the cart, to signing in, the shipping, to
      finalizing order, the affiliate tag will now show up for 
      you to verify
Added detection on first use
      - if it detects on first use of Amazon.com that no tag has
      been saved, the options page will automatically open
Changed to pageAction instead of browserAction
